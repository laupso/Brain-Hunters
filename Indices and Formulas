Here we upload the indices or formulas we use and write a brief description for them:


1 - Correct/Wrong Index (Normalized Firing Rate):
                    CWI = (mu(C) - mu(W)) / (mu(C) + mu(W)) * 100
    where mu(C) and mu(W) are the mean response ofeach neuron in a specific time window in correct and wrong trials, respectively.
    

2 - Fano Factor (an index of response variability):
                    FF = sigma^2/mu
    where sigma^2 and mu are the variance and mean of the spike count, respectively.
    The number of spikes was calculated in each time window in each trial
    The most common firing rate across all windows in both conditions was selected as the matching rate.
