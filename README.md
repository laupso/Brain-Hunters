# Brain-Hunters
Can pre-stimulus activity predict correct vs. incorrect response in a visual discrimination task in mice?

We will upload our codes in here for everybody to be able to edit  

PYTHON FILES:
  - basics_steinmetz.py: module containing basic functions to work with the Steinmetz dataset (importing the data, etc.)
  - plots_steinmetz.py: module containing useful functions to create beautiful plots
  - explore_steinmetz.py: basic script to explore the data and play with it


To-Do List: (to be updated)

Recorded brain regions of each session
Plot all neurons of areas of interest (Choice Regions & Task-related regions)
  - Prestimulus time in Go tasks:
      -- Average activity for correct vs. incorrect trials (and compare both with Miss trials)
      -- Variance (across trials) of activity for correct vs. incorrect trials (and compare both with Miss trials)
      -- Normalized firing rate in correct vs. incorrect trials (and compare both with Miss trials)

Plot the performance (proportion correct)
Models we intend to run:
  - GLM
  - Autoregression 
  - Hidden Markov Model
  - PCA
